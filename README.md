# Gun Dart

Gun Dart is a Dart wrapper around the [Gun JS](https://gun.eco/) library.

This library is almost a 1:1 port of the JS library, with some minor changes to
make it more Dart-like. Gun JS is a disctributed database that can be used to
build decentralized applications.

* Web support only.
* Null safety.
* SEA encryption.
